## This project is to generate a random password so you dont have to. This project is useful because as an employee with access to sensitive data I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security. Users can get started with the project by simply selecting "Generate Password" and answering a few prompts.
